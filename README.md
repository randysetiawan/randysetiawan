Future developer and lifelong creative thinker. I’m a second-year student at Bina Nusantara University with dreams of working in IT company. I want to help people to grow in this society.

My experience in information systems has brought my attention to software development, system analysis, and databases.

I plan to graduate with a bachelor in information systems. These concentrations have provided invaluable insight into the logical thinking, teamwork, and public speaking in today’s world. I hope that my hardskills and softskills will lead to a greater sense of future.
